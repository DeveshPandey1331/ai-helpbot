Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEXPoseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARALAltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter 35.75 GHz, 500MHz, 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARALAltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc   MissionsSARAL-AltiKaIntroduction Objectives SpaceCraft Payloads Data Products Documents Search Search Follow Us Website owned and maintained by MOSDAC, Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Govt. of INDIA.

It is currently available from March 2000 Onwards and offers a horizontal resolution of 0.1 X 0.1  on a latitudelongitude grid with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The dataset is based on the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation GSMaP algorithm Kubota et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021, 2022 with Indian Meteorological Department IMD gauge correction, and is a specialized product that focuses on the Indian landmass. The GSMaP algorithm, designed by the JAXA, is instrumental in creating a comprehensive view of precipitation using microwave radiometers and cloud moving data from Geostationary Infrared IR technology. The algorithm is separated into three primary categories for effective measurement: the microwave imager, microwave sounder, and microwave-infrared MVK combined Mega et al. 2019. A detailed verification of GSMaP_ISRO for the Indian summer monsoon periods of 2000-2020 against ground, satellite and various merge rainfall products is presented in Kumar et al. 2022.

Also, hydrological modelling studies face the challenge of decreasing availability of in-situ monitoring data. However, application of satellite radar altimetry over the inland water bodies becomes vital tool to estimate water levels through waveform retracking on satellite altimetry?s sensor data. SARAL-Altika was launched on 25 February 2013. It is a joint-mission of CNES France and ISRO to provide continuous monitoring of ocean and continental water surface. It was launched into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790km with 35 days of orbit repetition and follows same ground track as ENVISAT satellite. It has 98.55 deg of inclination with 75 km of equatorial cross track separation. It has Ka-band 35.75 GHz radar altimeter. Water level product for inland water bodies presently for Brahmaputra river and Ukai Reservoir has been generated using the SARAL-ALTIKA waveform data.

The first one is the Altimeter derived gridded Map of Absolute Dynamic Topography MADT generated from the suite of altimeters such as JASON-2, SARALALTIKA, Cryosat etc., the second data set is the gridded ocean surface vector winds derived ASCAT wind data and the last one is the gridded SST data derived from AVHRR. The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, 2002 is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration. Equatorial velocities are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products .

Lett., 4, 335-343, 2013. Processing Steps Using the daily gridded data of MADT, Vector winds and SST data the Geostrophic, wind driven and buoyancy components of the ocean surface current respectively are first calculated for the off-equatorial regions 3 N to 90 N and 3 S to 90 S. Using the polynomial expansion the equatorial currents  3  latitude band are derived. The daily ocean surface current at 0.25  resolution is then derived by applying a linear weighted average procedure to the equatorial and off equatorial current solutions with in the latitude band of   3  to   4  band.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The methodology follows the work of Bonjean and Lagerloef 2002. The basic equations are those of quasi linear and steady flow in a surface layer where the horizontal velocity U  u,v is allowed to vary with vertical coordinate z, and where vertical turbulent mixing is characterized by an eddy viscosity A uniform with depth. The vertical shear Uz reaches zero at a constant scaling depth z  - H. Using complex notations Ux,y,z,t  u  iv and      x  i   y , the basic equations are ifU  - 1 m   p  AUz 1a 1 m pz  -g    1b    g  T  SST , 1c with - H   z   0, and subject to the following boundary conditions Uz z0     A 2a Uz z  -H  0 2b The characteristic density is  m  1025 kg m -3, The acceleration due to gravity g  9.8 m s-2, and the coefficient of thermal expansion  T  3 x 10-4 K-1, The vector field     x  i   y represents the surface wind stress divided by  m, H has been chosen to be 70 m, The parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A  a WW1b  w 1 m s-1 where W1  1 m s-1 , a  8 x 10-5 m 2 s-1 , and b  2.2 where W1  1 m s-1 , a  8 x 10-5 m 2 s-1 , and b  2.2 . The equation for the velocity shear is Uz - ifA Uz  1A  3 which is a second-order differential equation in velocity shear Uz , subject to the boundary conditions 2a,b. After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is ifU0 -g    1H  qHhe   H2qH2he  4 Here the function q is defined by q x  x tanh x and he  Aif 12 is complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth he  sqrt 2Af. Using equation 4 and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities  3  latitude band are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef 2002. Limitations As the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents. Known problems with data As these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.

The primary input datasets utilized are sea surface salinity data from the SMAP mission and sea surface currents derived from altimetry. These datasets are obtained at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The SMAP mission has been operational since 2015, whereas altimetry-derived sea surface currents have been available since 1993. Validation of this reconstructed product was conducted against in-situ datasets obtained from thermo-salinographs. Results indicate that the reconstructed product more accurately captures front formation compared to the original SMAP salinity fields.

This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity SSS data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive SMAP satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against insitu data obtained from a thermo-salinograph. Further, the developed algorithm was modified to select the advection time dynamically. 7 Dataset Contact Jai Kumar, PODAOSGEPSA, Space Applications Centre ISRO, Ahmedabad, 380015, kumarjsac.isro.gov.in 8 Update Frequency Six months. 9 Access Rights or Restriction Open Access 10 Spatial Resolution Spatial resolution is 10 km 11 Language English 12 Topic Category High resolution sea surface salinity product SAC-TDP using satellite data. 13 Keywords Sea surface salinity, sea surface currents, Lagrangian advection technique, high resolution 14 Date or period April 2015 - June 2023 15 Responsible Party Jai Kumar, PODAOGG EPSA, Space Applications Centre ISRO, Ahmedabad-380015, India 16 Organization Space Applications Centre ISRO, Ahmedabad, India 16a Org. role Geophysical parameters from satellite data in the Bay of Bengal region. 16b Individual name Jai Kumar, PODAOSGEPSA, SAC ISRO, Ahmedabad-380015, India.

It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter AltiKa. Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARALAltika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker MLE4 itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak BAGP. Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product. 7 Dataset Contact Aditya Chaudhary, OSDAOSGEPSA, Space Applications Centre ISRO, Ahmedabad 380015, aditya.osdsac.isro.gov.in 8 Update frequency 35 cycles of SARALAltiKa have been processed.

The inputs are sea surface height anomaly AVISO, sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity. One more input is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, calculated from in-situ analysis system ISAS climatological data. The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum.

Limitations This method is only applicable in a region where the Coriolis parameter does not change abruptly. Also it is not applicable on the equator.Vertical movement is ignored in isQG framework.isQG method works well when the eddy kinetic energy EKE is low. If EKE is large, it will fail to generate accurate subsurface fields.We considered the Barotropic and the first Baroclinic modes only in our analysis. This certainly limits our approach.This method generates less satisfactory subsurface fields if the stratification is strong.The vertical resolution in our case is 10 m. This is a major drawback since in Bay of Bengal, the mixed layer can be as shallow as 15-20 m. Known problems with data Data problems due to bad weather heavy rain and extreme events like cyclones etc. File Naming Convention Netcdf file: isQG_yyyy.nc MetaData Sr. No Core Metadata Elements Definition 1 Metadata language English 2 Metadata Contact MOSDAC 3 Metadata date May, 2018 4 Data Lineage or Quality Sea surface height anomaly, Sea surface density anomaly in Bay of Bengal using isQG methodology. 5 Title Reconstruction of Ocean interior density and horizontal velocity anomaly  elds using Satellite data in Bay of Bengal 6 Abstract Satellite data has been used to reconstruct ocean interior density and velocity anomalies in the Bay of Bengal through the  interior  surface Quasigeostrophic  isQG method. The inputs are sea surface height anomaly AVISO, sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity. One more input is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, calculated from in-situ analysis system ISAS climatological data. The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum. Validation of retrieved density has also been performed using ARGO data which reveals that isQG is more promising when the stratification is weak . 7 Dataset Contact Anup Kumar Mandal, OSDAOSGEPSA, Space Applications Centre ISRO, Ahmedabad, 380015, anupmandalsac.isro.gov.in 8 Update Frequency Six months. 9 Access Rights or Restriction Open Access 10 Spatial Resolution Spatial resolution is 25 km, while vertical resolution is 10m 11 Language English 12 Topic Category Ocean subsurface product SAMUDRA Project using satellite data. 13 Keywords Density anomaly, Velocity anomaly, subsurface fields, 3D-Ocean fields 14 Date or period January 2017 - till date 15 Responsible Party Anup Kumar Mandal,OSDAOGG EPSA, Space Applications Centre ISRO, Ahmedabad-380015, India 16 Organization Space Applications Centre ISRO, Ahmedabad, India 16a Org. role Geophysical parameters from satellite data in the Bay of Bengal region. 16b Individual name Anup Kumar Mandal, OSDAOSGEPSA, SAC ISRO, Ahmedabad-380015, India.

Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height SSH anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height SSH from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies. There are 24 files each containing weekly eddy data information for individual year. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products . Request to use MOSDAC Single Sign On user credentials to download the data. Data Version Version 1.0 beta Data Sources The daily gridded map of Absolute Dynamic Topography data is obtained from AVISO ftp site ftp:ftp.aviso.oceanobs.com Website  Processing Steps Remove the long wavelength component of the SSH anomaly and retain the mesoscale features with the wavelength 50-500 km scale. Identified outer most closed contour of SSH anomaly. The closed contours are sequentially identified, analysed and checked essential criteria. Size and amplitude based thresholds for eddy detection were fixed after carrying out several trials. Eddies are detected and calculated the eddy parameters. Detected eddies are tracked individually.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm We have followed Chelton et. Al. 2007 in deriving the eddy census in Bay of Bengal with minor modifications in fixing the thresholds for eddy detection specific to this region. This was achieved after performing several trial experiments with different combinations of size and amplitude values. Limitations Accuracy assessment of the dataset has not been carried out. The number of eddies are depending upon the diameter and amplitude threshold. Only mesoscale eddies with maximum diameter of 400km are being considered. Known problems with data Less reliability of SSH data near the coast with altimetry is a known problem.

Accurate and timely advance prediction of tropical cyclones is very important to disseminate the warnings and preparedness. Prediction of development of any cyclone system in the North Indian Ocean is being done at Space Applications Centre ISRO Ahmedabad, using the in-house developed algorithms. Once the low-pressure system is formed, it is continuously monitored by satellite observations. The forecasts like cyclogenesis, track, intensity and landfall of cyclones, ship avoidance region, storm surge, coastal inundation etc. and satellite based cyclone information are disseminated through web-portal SCORPIO.
